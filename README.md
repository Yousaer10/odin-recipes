The project focuses on using html to create a simple recipe webpage, homepage contains the links to 3 recipe pages and the recipe pages display image of the dish, ingredients and steps on how to prepare the dish.

I fully understood the project and completed the project without running any issues.
I learned the following from the project: requirement of the html boilerplate, understanding of headers, paragraphs, images, ordered lists and unordered lists.
