    <p>This recipe makes flavorful turkey or chicken croquettes that are crisp on the outside but moist on the inside. <br> The way to keep the croquettes moist is by adding a homemade white sauce to the chicken mixture.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 cups finely chopped cooked chicken</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cups seasoned bread crumbs, divided</li>
        <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon celery seed</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into melted butter; cook and stir until flour is <br>
            cooked and a paste forms, about 1 minute. Slowly add milk and chicken broth into butter mixture, whisking constantly, until <br> 
            mixture is thick and smooth, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and cool slightly, about 10 minutes.</li>
            
        <li>Stir chicken, 1 cup bread crumbs, eggs, onion, parsley, garlic powder, celery seed, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; <br> 
            add cooled sauce to chicken mixture and stir until well combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until <br> 
            chilled and firm, at least 2 hours.</li>
            
        <li>Shape chilled chicken mixture into 6 patties. Pour remaining bread crumbs into a shallow bowl and roll each chicken patty in bread <br> 
            crumbs to coat completely.</li>
            
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties in hot oil, turning once, until patties are cooked through and <br> 
            golden brown on each side, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least <br> 
            165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
