    <p>These delicious brownie s'mores let you enjoy the popular campfire treat on <br> 
        top of a brownie. I consider myself a gourmet cook and originally thought <br> 
        these would just appeal to kids, but everyone loves them!</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (18.3 ounce) package fudge brownie mix (such as Betty CrockerÂ®)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>6 graham crackers</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cups miniature marshmallows</li>
        <li>8 (1.5 ounce) bars milk chocolate, coarsely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a <br> 
            9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make the brownies: Stir brownie mix, oil, eggs, and water <br> 
            together in a medium bowl until well blended. Pour batter <br> 
            into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the brownies are baking, make the topping: Break graham <br> 
            crackers into 1-inch pieces and place into a bowl. Add marshmallows <br>
             and chopped chocolate and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove brownies from the oven and sprinkle with topping ingredients. <br> 
            Return to the oven and continue to bake until a toothpick inserted <br> 
            2 inches from the side of the pan comes out clean, 7 to 10 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
