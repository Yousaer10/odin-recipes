     <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American <br> 
        style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty <br> 
        easy to make at home.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer <br> 
            bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth <br> 
            side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li>
        <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; <br> 
            sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
        <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the <br> 
            bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. <br>
            Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins <br> 
            to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. <br> 
            The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. <br> 
            Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and <br> 
            provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with <br>
             1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts <br> 
            are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer <br> 
            inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
